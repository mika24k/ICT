	<h1><b>Elon Musk claims Apple has 'threatened to withhold' Twitter from its apps store</b></h1>
		<p style="font-family:Verdana">By Clare Duffy, CNN Business<br>Updated 5:21 AM ST, Tue November 29, 2022</p>
		<p style="font-family:Verdana"><b>New York CNN Business</b> - Elon Musk on Monday claimed that Apple has "threatened" to pull Twitter 		
		from its iOS app store, a move that could be devastating to the company Musk just acquired for $44 billion</p>
		<p style="font-family:Verdana"><i>"Apple <u>(AAPL)</u> has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won't tell us 		
		why,"</i> Musk said in one of several tweets Monday taking aim at Apple  <u>(AAPL)</u> and its CEO for alleged moves that could 		
		undermmine Twitter's business.</p>
		<p style="font-family:Verdana">In another tweet, Musk claimed that Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter.<i>"Do they hate 		
		free speech in America,"</i> he said, in an apparent reference to his oft-stated desire to bolster his idea of free speech on the 		
		platform.<i>"What's going on here [Apple CEO Tim Cook]?"</i> Musk added in a follow-up tweet. He also <u>criticized</u> Apple's size, 		
		<u>claimed</u> it engages in "censorship", and <u>called out</u> the 30% transaction fee Apple charges large app developers to be 		
		listed in its app store..</p>
		<p style="font-family:Verdana">In one tweet Monday, Musk asked his nearly 120 million followers if they know <i>"Apple puts a secret
		30% tax on everything you buy through their App Store?"</i> In another tweet, he posted a picture of a highway exit: one lane headed 
		toward <i>pay 30%,"</i> the other pointed toward "go to war." An old car labeled "Elon" skidded toward the latter.</p>
