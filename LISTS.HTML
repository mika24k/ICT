 <ul type'disc'>
  <li>Mathematics
   <ol>
    <li>Quadratic Equation
     <dl>
      <dd>- A second-order polynomial equation in a single variable x=ax^2+bx+c=0 with a ≠ 0.
     </dl>
    <li>Quadratic Inequalities
     <dl>
      <dd>- A type of equation which does not have an equal sign and includes the highest degree two.
     </dl>
    <li>Quadratic Functions
     <dl>
      <dd>- One of the form f(x)=ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are numbers with a not equal to zero.
     </dl>
    <li>Forms of Quadratic Function
     <dl>
      <dd>- The general form of quadratic function is f(x)=ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real numbers, a ≠ 0, while 
          the standard form f(x) = a(x − h)^2 + k, called the vertex form, where a ≠ 0, and the point (h, k) is called the vertex.
     </dl>
    <li>Sum and Product of Roots of Quadratic Equation
     <dl>
      <dd>- The sum of the roots is equal to the negation of the coefficient of the second term, divided by the leading coefficient,
          while the product of the roots is equal to the constant term (the third term), divided by the leading coefficient.
     </dl>
   </ol>
  <li>Science

    <li>Respiratory System
     <dl>
      <dd>- It is the organs that are involved in breathing. These include the nose, throat, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs. 
          Also called respiratory tract.  
     </dl>
    <li>Circulatory System
     <dl>

     <dl>
      <dd>- A substance made from two or more different elements that have been chemically joined.
     </dl>
    <li>Acids
     <dl>
      <dd>- An acid is any substance that in water solution tastes sour, changes blue litmus paper to red, reacts with some metals to 
          liberate hydrogen, reacts with bases to form salts, and promotes chemical reactions.
     </dl>
    <li>Bases
     <dl>
      <dd>- A substance that can accept hydrogen ions in water and can neutralize an acid.
     </dl>
    <li>Salts
     <dl>
      <dd>- A substance produced by the reaction of an acid with a base. It consists of the positive ion (cation) of a base and the 
          negative ion (anion) of an acid.
     </dl>
