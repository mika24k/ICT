I’m an artist, and as everyone knows, artists are usually rather poor. 
Normally, I don’t mind about that. When the sun is shining, I sit on my 
favourite blade of grass and play music for everyone to listen to. I have 
lots of friends, and together we’ve formed an orchestra.

Everyone loves our music and says how cheerful it makes them feel – well 
almost everyone. There’s a family of <font color="violet" size="5"><b>ants</font></b> who never stop to listen. They 
take themselves far too seriously for music or enjoyment. All they do is 
work, work, work – even when the sun is shining.

“Hey You <font color="violet"><b>Ants</b></font>,” I said to them. “It’s a lovely <font color="green" size="5"><u>summer’s day</u></font>. Why don’t you 
rest your feet for a while, and listen to my sweet music?”

“No time to stop,” one of them said, panting away. “We’re far too busy stocking 
up food for winter.”

<font color="red" size="5"><sup>The months went by, and the days got shorter and colder. I was shivering so 
much that I couldn’t even sing. A hard frost was on the ground, and there wasn’t
a crumb to eat. I was so hungry! So I went to see that busy family of <font color="violet" size="5"><b>ants</b></font> and 
said: “Please Sirs, I’m a poor starving musician. Spare me a few crumbs from your 
store of food.”

Do you know what? Those <font color="violet" size="5"><b>ants</b></font> just turned their noses up at me. They were so 
stingy that they wouldn’t share any of their food.</sup></font> <font color="blue" size="5"><sub>Oh well, I’ll just have to go 
hungry this <font color="green" size="5"><u>winter</u></font>. In the New Year, I’ll make a resolution</sub></font>. <font color="yellow" size="5"><i>When the times are 
good, I’ll remember to save some food for a rainy day.</i></font>
